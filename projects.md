{% include JB/setup %}

After 20 years writing Java I learned about Go from my friend Travis Reeder (iron.io) and after a weekend using it, I was a convert. I've been doing my best to help the Go community grow by filling in needs for client software to popular Java libraries and 3rd party services.

In my past Java life, I was a contributor to a number of Java projects, including Castor XML & JDO, Hibernate, Apache ObjectBridge (OJB), Tomcat, and JBoss.

Elastigo
========
A Go (golang) based Elasticsearch client. Go is a really nice language to write easy-to-maintain system and server software in.

GoChimp
========
GoChimp is a Go (golang) based client for the MailChimp and Mandrill APIs.

Pizza Oven
==========
Literally a Pompeii style, wood burning pizza oven. I started with the [Forno Bravo](http://www.fornobravo.com/pompeii_oven/pompeii_oven.html) instructions, and fixed a number of issues with the plans along the way.
